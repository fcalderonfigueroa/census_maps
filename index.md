##  Mapping and Scaling Canadian Census Data

I found [Dominic Roy√©'s](https://github.com/dominicroye/mapa_dasimetrico/blob/main/dasimetrico_map.R) dasymetric maps using land cover data a few months back. Since then, I've been trying to figure out how to reproduce it for Canadian cities and metro areas. Then, I found [Dilinie Seimon's](https://rspatialdata.github.io/land_cover.html) tutorial on using MODIS land cover data in R. Combining these sources, I've been playing around. Here are some of the results from my little experiments.
